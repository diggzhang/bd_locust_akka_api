# Locust for bd_event

To run Locust with the above Locust file, if it was named 
locustfile.py and located in the current working directory, 
we could run:

```shell
locust -f locust_files/my_locust_file.py --host=http://example.com
```

To run Locust distributed across multiple processes we would 
start a master process by specifying --master:

```shell
locust -f locust_files/my_locust_file.py --master --host=http://example.com
```

and then we would start an arbitrary number of slave processes:

```shell
locust -f locust_files/my_locust_file.py --slave --host=http://example.com
```

If we want to run Locust distributed on multiple machines 
we would also have to specify the master host when starting 
the slaves (this is not needed when running Locust distributed 
on a single machine, since the master host defaults to 127.0.0.1):

```shell
locust -f locust_files/my_locust_file.py --slave --master-host=192.168.0.100 --host=http://example.com
```

Once youâ€™ve started Locust using one of the above command lines, 
you should open up a browser and point it to 
`http://127.0.0.1:8089` (if you are running Locust locally).
